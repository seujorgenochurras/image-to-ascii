# Why? 
A long time ago I started using [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) which is a command for those who uses terminal, and I saw an ASCII art of my linux distro. <br>
After that, I thought for a while and had the brilliant idea of making an ASCII art generator for java.

## Wait can I also do video???? 
  Kinda off, if you're on linux (**and you can only do it on linux**) you need to install a library called [video4j](https://github.com/metaloom/video4j). <br>
  Well, actually you don't need to install the library, just look for something called **libopencv_java460**<br>
